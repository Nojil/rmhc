## About
[Ronald McDonald Care Mobile](http://mchodessa.com/ronald-mcdonald-care-mobile/) is a medical clinic on wheels servicing Odessa
neighborhoods with unmet pediatric healthcare needs. This app offers a way to
discover where and when they can receive treatment from the RMCM unit.
This will cater specifically to Houston. The schedule is [here](http://www.texaschildrens.org/sites/default/files/RMCM%202016.pdf).

## Installation
This is a Meteor project, so [install that](https://www.meteor.com/install) first. Fork and clone the repo, navigate to the project directory, and run
meteor --settings settings.json from the command line.
